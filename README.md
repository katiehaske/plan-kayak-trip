## About the project 🌧️

Starting with a list of the top 35 best cities in France to visit, this project uses APIs and web scraping techniques to 
determine which cities and hotels would be the best to travel to in the next week based on forecasted weather conditions. 
The collected data is then stored in an AWS S3 bucket and uploaded into an RDS.

Libraries used include:
